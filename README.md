project_layers

This is a project to develop methods to better identify cortical layers on multi-channel electrode recordings.

+csd is a current source density toolbox for obtaining layer 4 from multi-channel electrodes
+gamma is a novel method to identify superficial, input, and deep layers on multi-chsnnel electrodes. Unlike CSD, it is not stimulus dependent.
